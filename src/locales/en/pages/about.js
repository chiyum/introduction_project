  "introduce.caption": `I am a front-end engineer who loves web design and development. I have nearly two years of development experience and specialize in Vue, JS, TS, Node.JS, React and other technologies. I am continuously exploring and researching interesting technologies with the skills I have learned. Once, I successfully hand-carved plugins like Swiper and tree structures, and also researched project architecture with my company's seniors. This not only let me understand the principles of these technologies more deeply but also taught me how to effectively solve problems. In the team, I have good and effective communication with PM and other front-end and back-end staff. And I actively cooperate with the team's progress, even do not mind working overtime. I like to communicate with people and look forward to the opportunity to cooperate in the future.`,

  "experience.experience.caption.3": `Before I entered the software industry, I had explored a variety of industries and explored various workplaces. I have served as a deputy manager in the chain catering industry, responsible for managing personnel and inventory; I have also worked in the hotel industry as a reserve cadre and front desk staff, and I have been a construction site apprentice and a teppanyaki chef. Each experience has taught me valuable knowledge and skills.

  "experience.experience.title.4": "Xiang Yi Digital Ltd.",
  "experience.experience.caption.4": `During my tenure as a Frontend Engineer at the company, I took on a particularly challenging task: developing games and their related architecture using the Vue framework. Typically, frameworks like Vue are rarely used in game development, making this task not only a technical venture but also a valuable learning and growth opportunity for me. In this project, I engaged in frontend interface design and delved into the interaction and maintenance of backend data. This experience was crucial in enhancing my frontend skills and understanding of the architecture of modern web applications.\nAdditionally, I used React and Vite to build the backend management system for the games. This system facilitated the management and analysis of game data, improving the efficiency and flexibility of game operations. This project not only strengthened my frontend development skills but also deepened my understanding of modern web development technologies and tools.`,
  "experience.education.title.1": "Equivalent to High School Diploma",
  "experience.education.caption.1": `In my younger years, due to naivety, I failed to fully grasp the importance of academics. However, as I grew older and my perspective broadened, I realized the value of learning and decided to make up for the academics I had previously neglected.
To achieve this goal, I was determined to continue my studies and supplement the education I lacked. In this process, I not only learned subject knowledge, but also deeply experienced the joy of learning and gained a clearer plan for my future career. Now, I understand more than ever that the process of learning and continuous progress is invaluable for personal and professional growth.
Therefore, even though I had neglected my studies in the early years, I learned lessons from my mistakes and laid a firmer foundation for my future.`,
  "experience.education.title.2": "Taichung Industrial Senior High School",
  "experience.education.caption.2": `I was fortunate to be admitted to my desired school when I was young. However, since I did not fully understand the importance of academics at the time, I chose to drop out of high school in the second year and enter the workplace.
At that time, filled with curiosity and expectation for the unknown world, I was eager to explore the diverse aspects of life. I believed that through actual work experience, I could understand myself better and discover my real interests and directions.
Even though I entered society early, I did not forget the importance of learning. I always maintained a thirst for knowledge and continuously improved myself, enabling me to better adapt and grow in the workplace.
Looking back, I do not regret my initial choice because that experience shaped who I am today. I believe that whether in school or at work, as long as I maintain a love and curiosity for knowledge, I can find my own path of learning and growth in life.`,

The school's education also gave me ample opportunities to deepen my computer skills. With the school's resources, I participated in related competitions, and in this process, further enhanced my understanding and operating ability of computers. In addition, I also worked hard to obtain related certifications, further proving my professional ability in this field.
Therefore, this period of experience can be considered as a stepping stone for me to enter the software industry.`,
