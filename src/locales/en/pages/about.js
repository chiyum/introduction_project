  "introduce.caption": `I am a front-end engineer who loves web design and development. I have nearly two years of development experience and specialize in Vue, JS, TS, Node.JS and other technologies. I am continuously exploring and researching interesting technologies with the skills I have learned. Once, I successfully hand-carved plugins like Swiper and tree structures, and also researched project architecture with my company's seniors. This not only let me understand the principles of these technologies more deeply but also taught me how to effectively solve problems. In the team, I have good and effective communication with PM and other front-end and back-end staff. And I actively cooperate with the team's progress, even do not mind working overtime. I like to communicate with people and look forward to the opportunity to cooperate in the future.`,
