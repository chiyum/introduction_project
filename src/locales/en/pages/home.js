    "I am a frontend engineer who loves web design and development. For over a year, I have been exploring and innovating, using my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. Once, I successfully handcrafted plugins like Swiper and tree structures, which not only allowed me to understand these tools more deeply but also taught me how to solve problems effectively. I have the ability to communicate effectively with developers, designers, and project managers, and I always actively cooperate with the company's progress, not minding working overtime. I love learning new technologies and tools, looking forward to more growth and learning opportunities in this company.",
