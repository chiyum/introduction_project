  "self.caption": `I am a passionate front-end engineer who loves web design and development. With nearly two years of development experience, I specialize in technologies such as Vue, TS, Nuxt.JS, and Node.JS.
  I utilize my skills to continually explore and research technologies that interest me. Once, I successfully manually coded plugins such as Swiper and tree structures. Simultaneously, I researched project architecture with my seniors at work. This not only gave me a deeper understanding of these technologies but also taught me how to solve problems effectively.
  In a team setting, I have strong and effective communication skills with project managers and other front-end and back-end colleagues. I actively align with the team's progress and don't mind working overtime. I enjoy interacting with people and look forward to the opportunity to collaborate in the future.`,
