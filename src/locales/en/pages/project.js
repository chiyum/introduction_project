  "list.content.1-1": `This project is a game integration platform, using AWD technology, and has designed separate repositories for PC and mobile versions.
Whether on a PC or a mobile device, the website will automatically adjust the layout based on the screen size of the user and direct to the page that adapicates the device, allowing users to have the best experience on any device.
This project also implements geographic routing to provide a faster and smoother browsing experience. The front end, upon loading, will automatically direct users to the nearest network node based on the geographic location of the user's IP address, thereby increasing web page loading speed and reducing network latency.`,
  "list.content.1-2": `Additionally, as a game integration platform, this project connects to game supplier APIs. This allows users to jump directly from our platform to the game page of the game vendor, achieving a one-stop gaming experience.
Finally, the website has also added a real-time chat feature. Through WebSocket, users can communicate in real time on the platform, similar to a line chat room.`,

    "This project was developed based on a custom Vue framework, which is somewhat similar to Nuxt, but with substantial enhancements in flexibility and customizability, allowing developers to customize features according to specific needs.",
  "list.content.2-2": `In terms of visual effects, we introduced Rive to create interactive animations, making the page more lively and interesting, greatly enhancing the user experience. Users can gain fun by interacting with the animations and further participate in our product.
Our project supports multiple languages with i18n, can automatically select the appropriate language based on the browser language settings, and also gives users the freedom to choose the language, ensuring the internationalization and diversity of our product.
Additionally, we provide a variety of interactive content, such as draggable activity icons and red dot reminders for new unread messages. These interactive elements not only enhance user engagement but also make information delivery more intuitive and efficient.`,
  "list.content.2-3": `This project has a test environment available for operation. If you want to experience operation, you can contact me, and I will provide a test account for you to use.
If you just want to view the custom Rive animation effect, you can >>Click me to go<<. There are animations for display on this website.`,
