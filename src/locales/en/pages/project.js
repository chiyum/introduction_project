  "list.content.1-1": `This project is a game integration platform that uses AWD technology and has designed separate repositories for PC and mobile versions.
Whether on a PC or a mobile device, the website will automatically adjust the layout based on the screen size of the user and direct to the page that adapts the device, ensuring the best experience on any device.
For a faster and smoother browsing experience, the project also implemented geographic routing. Upon loading, the frontend will automatically direct users to the nearest network node based on the geographic location of the user's IP address, thereby improving webpage loading speed and reducing network latency.`,
  "list.content.1-2": `In addition, as a game integration platform, this project connects to game supplier APIs. This allows users to directly jump from our platform to the game page of the game vendor, achieving a one-stop gaming experience.
Lastly, the website has also added a real-time chat feature. Through WebSocket, users can conduct real-time online conversations on the platform, similar to a line chat room.`,

    "This project was developed based on a custom Vue framework, which is somewhat similar to Nuxt, but has been substantially enhanced in terms of flexibility and customizability, allowing developers to customize functions according to specific needs.",
  "list.content.2-2": `In terms of visual effects, the project introduced Rive to create interactive animations, which are made by designers using Rive software and then processed by the frontend using Rive's kit for screen and logic. Users can gain enjoyment through interacting with the animations, enhancing the user experience.
At the same time, the project uses i18n to support multiple languages and automatically selects the appropriate language according to the browser's language settings, but still retains the feature allowing users to freely choose the language.
Moreover, the project has added many functions in response to needs, such as draggable activity icons, red dot reminders for new unread messages, etc. These interactive elements are combined with APIs or other pure frontend logic and screen processing according to requirements.`,
  "list.content.2-3": `This project has a test environment available for operation. If you want to experience operation, you can contact me, and I will provide a test account for you to use.
If you just want to view the custom Rive animation effect, you can >>Click me to go<<. There are animations for display on this website.`,
